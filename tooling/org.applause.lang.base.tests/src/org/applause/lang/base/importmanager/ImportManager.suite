#Import Manager Suite

The import manager is an important component for the code generators that are used in Applause. An import manager helps to 
keep track of classes that need to be imported into a source code file. As you can imagine, import managers vary from language to 
language: some language have a notion of _packages_ or _namespaces_ (such as Java and C\#), while others don't have any such 
concept (such as _Objective\-C_).
